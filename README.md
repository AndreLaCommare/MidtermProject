<h3 align="left">Project Take Aways:</h3>
<h3 align="left">My main take away was learning how to setup, insert data and maintain a database. Learning how all the mapping is done based on the table and its relationship to another table was a big eye opener. - Kenny, Database Administrator</h3>

<h3 align="left">One of my main take aways from this lab is ensuring the user's data is always refreshed in session, that way their data populates in real time. Another takeaway would be working with a multitude of jsps, contorllers, and DAO/DaoImpl's. Implementing different features can often lead to exceptions occuring in a different feature. Being able to find the root cause of the exception is crucial to complete the implementations in the project. - Angel, Scrum</h3>
