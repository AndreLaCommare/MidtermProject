<h3 align="left">Project Take Aways:</h3>
<h3 align="left">"My main take away was learning how to setup, insert data and maintain a database. Learning how all the mapping is done based on the table and its relationship to another table was a big eye opener." - Kenny, Database Administrator</h3>

<h3 align="left">"One of my main take aways from this lab is ensuring the user's data is always refreshed in session, that way their data populates in real time. Another takeaway would be working with a multitude of jsps, contorllers, and DAO/DaoImpl's. Implementing different features can often lead to exceptions occuring in a different feature. Being able to find the root cause of the exception is crucial to complete the implementations in the project." - Angel, Scrum dude</h3>

<h3 align="left">"My main take away from this sprint was the importance of pair programming in order to ensure that we as a team are synchronized across repositories, both local and remote, as well as aid in understanding of the code itself. Where one member struggled to write or implement a method another could assist in the navigator role and keep the development process moving. This project also forced comfort with GitHub and merge conflicts when they occurred, and with the remote development process in general, keeping track of multiple branches, committing often, and staying up to date with the main branch." - Andre, Repo Owner</h3>

<h3 align="left">"I've learned that it's important to avoid containerizing everything on the backend CSS and relying solely on formatting. By keeping stylesheets organized and readable, I can more easily navigate my code and make changes as needed." - Sebastian, Front-end Wizard</h3>
